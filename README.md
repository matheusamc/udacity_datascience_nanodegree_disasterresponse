<h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This project is part of the requirements of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project we want to explorer the avaible data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/rio-de-janeiro/">Inside Airbnb</a> for the listings in Rio de Janeiro for the year of 2022. Taking a closer look at this data we expect to answer the following questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>In what neighbourhood to stay in Rio?</i></li>
    <li><i>What price weexpected to pay in these places during the main events in the city?</i></li>
    <li><i>What time of the year to come paying better prices?</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will make use of some Python libraries in a Jupyter notebook and the knowledge achieved in the course to answer these questions.</p>

<h2>Summary of Results</h2>
  <p>After analisyng the avaiable data we answered the three questions above:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The locations with most listing in Airbnb which include Copacabana, Ipanema, Barra da Tijuca, Leblon, Botafogo, Santa Teresa, Centro, Flamengo, Leme and Laranjeiras.</li>
    <li>During New Years' Eve and Carnival, someone would expect to pay from US$90/day to US$350/day.</li>
    <li>The period from the end of July to the beggining of November is the one with best prices.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The results are detailed presented in <a href="https://medium.com/@matheusamc/cidade-maravilhosa-when-to-visit-1a35d1ba7e1f">this post</a>.</p>
